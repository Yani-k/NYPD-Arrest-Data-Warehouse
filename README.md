Analyzing NYPD Arrests and 311 Service Requests 

Description:

Our group aims to explore the relationship between public safety-related complaints reported to
NYC 311 and the types of arrests made by the NYPD across different neighborhoods. We will
focus on arrest categories to analyze whether there is a correlation between the frequency of
these complaints and subsequent arrests. By integrating NYC 311 data with the NYPD’s arrest
data, which includes information on the type of crime, location, and time of enforcement, we
hope to identify patterns that highlight how community-reported issues translate into police
action.
We will utilize arrest data going back to 2006 through the end of the previous calendar year,
which is manually reviewed and posted quarterly by the NYPD’s Office of Management
Analysis and Planning. This dataset will help us understand the enforcement trends in response
to various complaints. Our goal is to shed light on public safety dynamics, investigating whether
areas with high volumes of complaints see a corresponding increase in arrests and if certain types
of complaints are more predictive of arrests than others.
